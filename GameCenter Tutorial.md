#GameCenter Integration in Swift
###### Written by Luke Solomon

##Introduction
Gamecenter is a Framework that Apple has made available in iOS for developers to very easily track player progress, integrate leaderboards, and allows players to challenge one another (also known as matchmaking). 

This tutorial will show you how to easily add GameCenter into your game to add all these totally awesome and amazing features. I will use my own game, [Seige](http://www.github.com/ares42/seige) for this and several tutorials in the future. Feel free to clone or fork the repository on Github (but star it so that I can get magical internet points).


##Before We Begin
####Please Note: You must have a developer account! If you haven't signed up for one yet, [click here](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/)! 

GameCenter integration is broken down into 3 steps:

1. [iOS Developer Center](http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action)
2. [iTunes Connect](https://itunesconnect.apple.com/)
3. XCode Implementation
